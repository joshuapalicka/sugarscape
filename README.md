<h1 align="center">sugarscape</h1>
==========

Python implementation of Epstein and Axtell's large scale agent-based computational model, the Sugarscape, to explore the role of social phenomenon such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture.  
In other words: Cellular Automata + Agents = Sugarscape.

Code based on previous work by Herv√© Lange: https://github.com/langerv/sugarscape

###### A realization of the Proto-History under rules ({G1}, {M,S,K}) and random distribution of agents, showing: migration, spatial segregation, mating, cultural transmission and finally tribes interaction such as collisions, penetrations, and conversions producing complex social histories :

### Instructions
Install Python 3.6 and above: https://www.python.org.  
Install Pygame 2.1 package: http://www.pygame.org.  
On command schell, execute: `python sugarscape.py`.  
Edit `sugarscape.py` and uncomment settings for the wanted simulation, run again.

##### Available controls during simulation:
- **[F1]**  : show current agents population.
- **[F2]**  : show current agents whealth histogram.
- **[F3]**  : show current agents metabolism and vision mean values.
- **[F12]** : start / pause / resume simulation.
