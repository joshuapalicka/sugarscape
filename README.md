<h1 align="center">sugarscape</h1>

Python implementation of Epstein and Axtell's large scale agent-based computational model, the Sugarscape, to explore the role of social phenomenon such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture.  
In other words: Cellular Automata + Agents = Sugarscape.

This repository contains the base code that is being used in Sugarscape-Utilicalc, an implementation of Jeremy Bentham's Felicific Calculus in the Sugarscape, which can be found here: https://github.com/joshuapalicka/sugarscape-utilicalc

More info is available in the project wiki.

### Instructions
Install Python 3: https://www.python.org.
Clone the repository.
Our implementation requires matplotlib to run. You can install this library yourself, or through pip install -r requirements.txt.
In command shell, execute: `python sugarscape.py`.  
Edit `settings.json` for the wanted simulation, run again.
